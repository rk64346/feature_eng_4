"""Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?"""


# In[2]:


"""Data encoding is the process of converting information from one format or representation to another, usually for the purpose of storage or transmission. In the context of data science, it's a crucial concept because it allows for the efficient storage and handling of different types of data.

Here are some common types of data encoding:

Numeric Encoding: This involves representing categorical data as numbers. For example, if you have categories like "red," "green," and "blue," you might assign them numerical values like 1, 2, and 3.

One-Hot Encoding: This is a specific type of numeric encoding used for categorical data where each category is represented as a binary vector. This is useful because it doesn't introduce ordinality (meaning, one category is not inherently greater than another). For example, in the previous example, "red" might be represented as [1, 0, 0], "green" as [0, 1, 0], and "blue" as [0, 0, 1]."""

"""Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario."""


# In[5]:


"""nominal encoding is a type of data encoding used to represent categorical data where the categories have no inherent order or ranking. In nominal encoding, each category is assigned a unique numerical value or label. This encoding is suitable when there is no meaningful relationship or hierarchy between the categories.

Example of Nominal Encoding:

Let's consider a real-world scenario of encoding colors for a fashion dataset:

Suppose you have a dataset of clothes with a "Color" column, and the possible colors are "Red," "Blue," "Green," and "Yellow." Since these colors have no inherent order, you can use nominal encoding to represent them with numerical labels"""


# In[6]:


"""Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example."""


# In[8]:


"""Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where the categorical variables have a large number of unique categories. One-hot encoding can result in a high-dimensional and sparse representation of the data, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Nominal encoding provides a more compact representation.

Example:

Consider a dataset containing information about products in an e-commerce platform. One of the categorical features is "Product Category," which can have a large number of unique categories (e.g., hundreds or thousands). Using one-hot encoding in this scenario would result in a dataset with a very large number of columns, with most of them being zeros because each category would get its own column."""


# In[9]:


"""Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values. Which encoding
technique would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms?
Explain why you made this choice."""


# In[10]:


"""Consideration for One-Hot Encoding:

If there are only 5 unique values and they do not have a clear ordinal relationship, using one-hot encoding might also be feasible. One-hot encoding would create 5 binary columns, one for each category, and indicate the presence or absence of each category."""


# In[11]:


"""Q5. In a machine learning project, you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns. Two of the columns
are categorical, and the remaining three columns are numerical. If you were to use nominal encoding to
transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations."""


# In[12]:


"""If you use nominal encoding on a categorical variable with 
�
k unique categories, it will result in 
�
−
1
k−1 new columns. This is because you only need 
�
−
1
k−1 columns to represent all possible categories; if all of them are zero, it implies the category not represented in those columns."""

"""Q6. You are working with a dataset containing information about different types of animals, including their
species, habitat, and diet. Which encoding technique would you use to transform the categorical data into
a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Justify your answer."""


# In[14]:


"""nominal encoding would be the preferred technique for all three categorical variables in this dataset. This encoding method allows us to represent the different categories in a numerical format without implying any order or hierarchy among them. This is important for preserving the integrity of the categorical information when used in machine learning algorithms."""

"""Q7.You are working on a project that involves predicting customer churn for a telecommunications
company. You have a dataset with 5 features, including the customer's gender, age, contract type,
monthly charges, and tenure. Which encoding technique(s) would you use to transform the categorical
data into numerical data? Provide a step-by-step explanation of how you would implement the encoding."""
